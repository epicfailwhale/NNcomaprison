# A comparison of generative network outputs following dimensionality reduction

This project was done through a neuroscience lens, my first bridge from neuroscience to neural networks. What can artificial neural networks tell us about how human brains retain and process information? 

Report in RANN Project.pdf

Code in notebooks, data in MNIST_data

Techniques: PCA, autoencoders and generative adversarial networks

We reduce dimensions, then recreate the images to see what each technique has retained.
