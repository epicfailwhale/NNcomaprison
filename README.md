# A comparison of generative network outputs following dimensionality reduction

This project was done through a neuroscience lens, what can artificial neural networks tell us about how human brains retain and process information? 

Dataset: MNIST

Techniques: PCA, autoencoders and generative adversarial networks

We reduce dimensions, then recreate the images to see what each technique has retained.
